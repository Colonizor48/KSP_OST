README:

To install this, you must install Soundtrack Editor Forked along with its
dependencies.

Simply replace the Music and Playlists folder installed by that mod with the
folders included in this mod. Enjoy!

Selected songs from this project will be available for streaming soon. If you
can stream my music, it will help me as a musician! If you enjoy the music,
please consider doing so.
